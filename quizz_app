# Definitions

* Class is a blue print

* Objects are like people. They’re living, breathing things that
- have knowledge inside them about how to do things (methods) and
- have memory inside them so they can remember things (attributes).

* Attributes are things that a object has. Basically variables.
* Methods are things that a object does. A function that is attached to an object is called method

* Constructor:
What Problem does constructor is solving?
How can i specify all the starting pieces of information when i create object from a class.
Constructor is part of the blueprint that allows us to specify what should happen when our object is being constructred.

Initialing is setting something to its starting value. Python creates space in memory to remember details of attributes

* Self it a way for us to refer to the object that going to be created from the class blueprint. Self is the object being created.
