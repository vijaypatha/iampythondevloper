# #STEP 1: Remember the Syntax Structure

# something = "anything"
# command = "do this"

# #Sytax 1: Simple if/else
# if something:
#   command
# else:
#   command

# #Sytax 2: if/elif/else
# if something:
#   command
# elif something:
#   command
# elif something:
#   command
# else:
#   command 

# #Sytax 3: nested ifs

# if something:
#   if something:
#     command
#   else:
#     command
# else:
#   command

# # STEP 2: Read the structure 

# Indentation indicates block of code 
# 1st block is if 
# 2nd block is else

# in syntax 3; the first block of code if has another if block init. 

# in syntax 2; we have if block, elif block, elif block, and else block.

# STEP 3: UNDERSTAND THESE EXCERSIZES
