'''
#1. Understand the Problem (Articulate what is the problem) (S, C, *Q*)



#2. Logic tress should help you break down the problem into small groups/sections and ToDo assoicated with each groups

1. Display: A,B, and ask question
2. Compare: A and B (Who has more followers?)
3. Feedback: That correct or wrong. 
4. SCORE: Track score
5. Next steps: Correct answer will become A and then there will new B. and game continues 
6. Dynamic Score: Keep increasing the score. 


#3. Design your approch to tackel each of the ToDos, for a code start with a Psuedo code for each ToDO

# TODO
1. Display
$ text [Done]
$ keys and values from dictionary (manual)
$ loop access it later

#4. Write code -> Run Code -> Fix the code until ToDo is complete (Logic trees to find solutions and then converge)
